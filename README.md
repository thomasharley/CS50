# CS50
Exercises completed as I walked through the Harvard CS50 Introduction to Computer Science Class. 

A mix of languages were utilised including C, Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

Development occurred in both Linux and Windows environments.

Where possible I have not used the CS50 libraries to assist me and have instead built solutions from scratch.
