To calculate the audio aura you could:
    1. compute the average energy of the 100 songs
    2. compute the average valence of the 100 songs
    3. compute the average danceability of the 100 songs
    4. average these three numbers to compute 'audio aura' field for the user.

However, this may not be representative as this assumes equal weighting of energy, valence and danceability to compute users 'audio aura'.

A user may preference the energy of a song over its danceability, vice-versa, etc.

These three fields are also a bit limiting, there may be aspects of songs not captured by these three metrics.

We should add in things like tempo, duration_ms, loudness, speechiness. But this becomes trickier as these are not values between 0 and 1.

We would have to come up with a way to convert these to values that could be averaged along with the other parameters.
